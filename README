PassiveCounterCache
===================

Adds support for simple counter cache updating that can be hooked into background processing.  Rails counter caching is disabled
and a method is provided to update caches from a background process.


Example
=======

class Cart < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :wheels
end

class Wheel < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :cart, :passive_counter_cache => true
end

Create a cart and four wheels
>> c = Cart.create
>> 4.times do { c.wheels.create }

As part of a BackgroundRb (or similar) scheduled task execute:
>> PassiveCounterCache.update_all_caches!

>> c.reload!
>> c.wheel_count
=> 4
